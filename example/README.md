# Welcome to the SCIONLab workshop!

This folder contains files you can use to get started:

- `example.py`: starting code that uses the SCION API to send data through a single path
- `scionlab.sh`: wrapper around `curl` that simplifies signup, submitting, and log retrieval
- `pyscion.py`: mocks the actual `pyscion` API so that you can run your code locally for debugging
- `stdin.txt`: sample task assignment (you'll get this on your standard input)

Test your code locally with `python3 ./example.py < stdin.txt`.
