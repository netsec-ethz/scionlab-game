This is supposed to do this:

1. master gets the CSVs from Giac
   (master.cfg reads them and makes the buildbot config out of them)
2. master gets code from $SOMEWHERE
3. master copies the files to workers, and tells them to run the Python code
   - kills the python after $TIMEOUT
4. master gets back logs from the workers
5. master gives logs back to the users $SOMEHOW
5. master computes scores and publishes them on a webby thing
