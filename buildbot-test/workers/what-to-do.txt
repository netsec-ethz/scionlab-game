This is supposed to do this:

1. master gets the CSVs from Giac
   (master.cfg reads them and makes the buildbot config out of them)
1a. giac: master knows the map TEAM_NAME:TEAM_ID by reading the file
        `teams/team_ids.csv`
2. master gets code from $SOMEWHERE
   giac: master gets the code from each team from `teams/<teamID>/code`. The
            code to be run is the code with the most recent timestamp.
3. master copies the files to workers, and tells them to run the Python code
   - kills the python after $TIMEOUT
4. master gets back logs from the workers
5. master gives logs back to the users $SOMEHOW
   giac: master copies the logs back to `teams/<teamID>/logs` with a timestamp
            on the log. The users can then GET the log from the webserver
6. master computes scores and publishes them on a webby thing.
